David Gilson's Portfolio

I created this page to showcase my design and coding skills, intending to provide potential employers and clients with a concise understanding of how I can contribute to the success of their organization.

## Description

This project encompasses four distinct pages. The Portfolio homepage serves as a comprehensive introduction, offering insights into my background, credentials, contact information, and overarching intentions and goals. The remaining three pages delve into detailed case studies showcasing my work. These include a website redesign for Goldie and Papis' animal rescue, an application design project centered on enhancing user experience in e-waste recycling, and the front-end development of a marketing webpage facilitating seamless rental property applications for tenants.
